## Want to Contribute to the Translation? <a id="want-to-translate"></a>

Thank you for your interest in Klaytn Docs! As an open source project, Klaytn Docs is open for contribution by anyone, which means you can also participate in the translation of the English version into other languages.

However, **you are not supposed to push to this repo directly.** 

Instead, you can contribute to the translation on the [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/klaytn-docs) platform.

**Workflow summary**

- Submitted translations get approved by our maintainers.
- The approved translations will be pushed to the `l10n` branch of `klaytn-docs`. The `dev` branch of this repo mirrors the `ko/docs` subfolder of `klaytn-docs:l10n` periodically. 
- Our maintainers will merge the changes to the `main` branch, which will be reflected at https://ko.docs.klaytn.com. 

Note: **Do NOT push to `klaytn-docs:l10n` directly.** It will be overwritten by Crowdin and the changes will get lost.
