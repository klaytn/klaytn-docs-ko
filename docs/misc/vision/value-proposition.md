Klaytn divides its target customers into three groups. 1) 일반 사용자, 2) 서비스 제공자, 3) 기업입니다. Klaytn’s Value Proposition to these groups is **Hassle-Free and Hybrid Blockchain Optimized for Services and Enterprises.** It is easy for ordinary users to use and, it provides the optimized blockchain environment to service and enterprises.

### 1) 일반 사용자 관점: 최초의 블록체인 경험을 제공해주는 플랫폼 <a id="1-ordinary-users-point-of-view-platform-that-provides-the-first-blockchain-exper"></a>

Going beyond crypto-savvy users with a long-standing interest in blockchain and cryptocurrency, Klaytn focuses on ordinary users. But it is not blockchain itself that creates values for users, but the applications. Blockchain technology should in fact be invisible to the end user. However, blockchain user experience until today has had a high entrance barrier for the general public.

Klaytn strives to provide a blockchain environment that is easily approachable. But this is not something to be dealt with on the platform itself, but rather at the level of tools surrounding the platform (wallet, exchanges, AppStore, etc.), which need to present a new environment that fits the expectation of ordinary users. Klaytn will lead and cooperate with them to allow end users to have the best blockchain experience.

### 2) 서비스 제공자 관점: 최적의 서비스 환경과 글로벌 유저 확보 지원 <a id="2-service-provider-s-point-of-view-support-of-optimized-service-environment-and"></a>

Klaytn seeks to promote business innovation by providing an optimized environment for dApps to flourish. We believe that blockchain can fuel disruptive innovations, just as the smartphone unleashed new forces leading to the mobile revolution. Then what is an optimized service environment? It would at least need to provide an environment similar to the present mobile application. But blockchain has many limitations, such as slow service response. Due to the nature of the blockchain technology, it requires the consent of the participating nodes. Klaytn has realized a block generation with 1-second finality, making it comparable to a mobile application. At the same time, Klaytn processes up to 4,000 transactions per second, a figure that will go up consistently.

Currently, blockchain finds itself appealing to an exclusive group of crypto users. There is a shortage of channels to attract general users, which is why the DAUs (Daily Ative Users) in most blockchain services do not go beyond thousands. In response, Klaytn aims to secure various user acquisition channels, especially by leveraging the existing user base of well-established enterprises through their incorporation of blockchain to preexisting mobile services. This would create the breeding ground for dApps with potentially millions of DAUs.

### 3) 기업 관점: Blockchain Enabler for Enterprise <a id="3-enterprises-point-of-view-blockchain-enabler-for-enterprise"></a>

We provide an optimized environment to enterprises that lead innovation and create new business opportunities using blockchain. This requires an easily accessible environment that also offers blockchain's benefits. But the requirements of businesses are different than those of ordinary dApps. Klaytn will provide three features tailored to meet these special needs of enterprises.

#### 서비스체인: 독립적인 블록체인 운영을 위한 Private Chain <a id="service-chain-private-chain-for-independent-operation-of-blockchain"></a>

Klaytn provides its own L2 Solution (Sidechain) called Service Chain for enterprises that are hesitant to use public blockchain due to data security issues. Service Chain allows enterprises to build their own blockchain. At the same time, it can guarantee a certain level of credibility through linkage with the Klaytn mainnet, while remaining a private blockchain.

#### Governance by Trusted Entities: Enterprise level stable consensus and governance <a id="governance-by-enterprises-enterprise-level-stable-consensus-and-governance"></a>

Trusted entities mainly consisting of global listed enterprises are the operators of Klaytn nodes. They also belong to the Klaytn Governance Council (KGC) and participate in the decision making process surrounding Klaytn's development. The Council members, being large-scale enterprises that deal with hundreds of thousands to billions of dollars, take reputation very seriously. This itself prevents them from doing anything that might jeopardize their public image. All KGC members are not only involved in node operation and governance, but they are also our business partners interested in incorporating blockchain technology based on Klaytn.
